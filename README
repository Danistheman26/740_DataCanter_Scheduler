This whole project is just written in python so it should be fairly easy to run.
I am running on window (though I think this can run on linux as well if needed) with python 3.9

To install dependencies, use command: pip install -r Requirements.txt

This should install all libraries needed. Because this is an reinforcement learning project, I needed
tensorflow. If tensorflow is giving issues with installation you might need to contact me as it needs a
c++ compiler visible. If running on windows, you might need to install one, otherwise I have not had any
issue with tensorflow on linux.

After all dependencies installed, to simulate just run: python3 main.py

You can also change the Configs.py file to test out different configurations such as changing the number
of job generators, the time spent training, weather to use RL or random scheduler. The config option are
described in the file itself.
